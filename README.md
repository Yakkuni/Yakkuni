## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m actually doing the course of Systems Analysis and Development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with python and Java, are the two languages â€‹â€‹that interested me most.
- ðŸ’¬ If you want help, you can ask, I don't guarantee you will get an answer, but I will help as much as I can! ^(. .)^
- âš¡ Fun fact: I grew up enjoying electronic games and one day I want to program and launch at least one game on the market, as a personal desire. (~^.^)~
